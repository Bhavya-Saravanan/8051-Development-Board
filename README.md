**8051 Development Board**

**üìå Project Overview**

This project documents the design and implementation of a custom 8051 development board based on the AT89C51RC2 microcontroller. The board was built to support firmware development, peripheral interfacing, and debugging experiments, making it a versatile platform for embedded systems learning and testing.

**Key highlights:**

Integrated regulated power supply, crystal oscillator, and power-on reset circuitry.

Added RS-232 interface (MAX232) for in-circuit programming and UART communication.

Expanded external memory with 32 KB NVSRAM mapped as XRAM using multiplexed address/data bus.

Included LCD, EEPROM, SPI DAC, and I/O expanders for driver development and application testing.

**‚öôÔ∏è Features**

**Microcontroller Core**

AT89C51RC2 with programmable flash and serial UART interface.

**External Memory Expansion**

32 KB NVSRAM with SPLD-based glue logic for chip-select & address decoding.

P**eripheral Support**

Bit-banged I¬≤C for EEPROM.

SPI DAC for analog output testing.

LCD module for text/visual output.

**Debugging Tools**

HEXDUMP display, read/write operations, and protocol verification with oscilloscope/logic analyzer.
